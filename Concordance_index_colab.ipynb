        "Concordance index is a useful metric to evaluate the predictions made by an algorithm. It can consider the case of right-censoring, i.e., when by the end of the study, the event of interest (for example, in medicine 'death of a patient' or in our example 'churn of a customer') has only occurred for a subset of the observations. We have seen three libraries (lifelines, scikit-survival, and PySurvival) who implement the concordance index but with some subtle differences."
